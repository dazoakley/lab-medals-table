# LAB Medals Table Generator

This repo contains all the data and code to generate the LAB (London Amateur Brewers) medals table and associated data files.

Here is the generated output:

- Medals Table: https://londonamateurbrewers.co.uk/medal-table/
- Roll of Honour: https://londonamateurbrewers.co.uk/roll-of-honour-medals/
- Medals List (CSV): https://londonamateurbrewers.co.uk/medal-table/roll-of-honour.csv
- Points Over Time (CSV): https://londonamateurbrewers.co.uk/medal-table/points-over-time.csv

## Running the Generator(s)

You'll need to have the version of ruby defined in [.tool-versions], then simply run any of the scripts in [bin].

If you'd like to see the medals table, you can run `make serve` and a local webserver will serve the table on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Adding New BJCP Style Guidelines
